# WT De-Rename

Bring back original names to the localized weapon copies (like: `PL-2` -> `R-3S`, `RB24` -> `AIM-9B`, `R-60MK` -> `R-60M`, ...)

### How to DeRename:
0. Steps: 0-2 from _manual_ manual below
0. Dawnload `units_weaponry.csv` (like: from [Release WT_DeRename v1.1 Â· Challanger524/WT_DeRename](https://github.com/Challanger524/WT_DeRename/releases#:~:text=4-,units_weaponry.csv))
0. Copy `units_weaponry.csv` to `War Thunder/lang/` folder

### How to DeRename (manually):

0. you must have enabled **custom localization** in `War Thunder/config.blk`
	- https://wiki.warthunder.com/Instructions_for_the_user_localizations
	- then start the game to generate `War Thunder/lang/` folder
0. enter `War Thunder/lang/` folder
0. rename `units_weaponry.csv` -> `_units_weaponry.csv` (prepend frontal underscore) to preserve original file
0. copy the renamed `_units_weaponry.csv` and (re)place it near the `WT_DeRename.exe`
0. make sure `units_weaponry-rename.csv` is near `WT_DeRename.exe` too
	- `units_weaponry-rename.csv` table format is self-explainable
0. run the `WT_DeRename.exe` (will produce/rewrite `units_weaponry.csv`)
0. copy `units_weaponry.csv` to `War Thunder/lang/` folder

Hints:
- You can use text compare tool/editor (like: `VSCode`) to see the difference between `.csv` files
